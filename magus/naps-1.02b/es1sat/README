Es1-sat is a extended SAT solver based on minisat2 (version 2.2.0).
It also accepts elementary symmetric clauses with k=1 (ES1-clauses),
which is in forms of
  ! 1 -2 3 0
This clause is interpreted to be true if exactly one literal is true.

For CNFs without ES1-clauses, es1sat works as if minisat-2.2.0.

only files under core/ are modified from the original minisat
